# CodeIslander: Interactive Python Learning Platform

An interactive web platform for learning Python, built on a powerful Django backend. This project focuses on secure code execution and instant user feedback.

## Technical Features

* **Interactive Python Exercises:** Allows users to learn Python by writing and running code directly in the browser.
* **Secure Code Sandbox:** Implemented a secure code execution sandbox using **Docker** to run user-submitted Python code in an isolated environment, preventing system access.
* **Auto-Grading System:** Built an auto-grading feature to provide instant feedback and validation for coding exercises by comparing the sandboxed code's output to the expected solution.
* **User Authentication & Progress:** Leveraged **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** for secure user authentication and persistent tracking of user progress through various lessons and modules.

## Tech Stack
