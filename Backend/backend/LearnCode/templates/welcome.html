            <h2>üöÄLearn Python by Playing!</h2>
            <p>CodeIslander is an interactive game that guides you through quizzes, exercises, and small bits of theory ‚Äî no prior experience needed.
            In CodeIslander, players explore their learning journey through a dynamic, game-like map UI. Each Python concept ‚Äî like variables, functions, and loops ‚Äî is introduced as a new chapter, represented by a different island. Every island has its own unique theme, making the adventure engaging, visual, and fun.
